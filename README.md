# Environmental-Conservation-and-Sustainability
# Introduction 
This Azure DevOps plan outlines the project management, development, and deployment processes for the Environmental Conservation and Sustainability Dashboard. It includes setting up Azure Boards for task management, Azure Pipelines for CI/CD, and Azure Artifacts for package management. Each step is integrated with the corresponding exam topics used to study for the Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate exam.

### Getting Started

Welcome to the Environmental Conservation and Sustainability Dashboard project! This guide will help you get your code up and running on your own system.

#### Installation Process

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jazz-L/Environmental-Conservation-and-Sustainability.git
   cd Environmental-Conservation-and-Sustainability
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary software installed:
     - **Azure DevOps**
     - **SQL Server**
     - **SQL (Azure SQL DB)**
     - **Azure Synapse Pipelines**
     - **Power BI Desktop**
     - **PowerApps**
   

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for database management.
   - Install Azure Data Studio for Synapse Pipeline management.

4. **Database Setup:**
   - Restore the provided database backup or run the SQL scripts in the `sql` directory to set up the database schema, tables, views, and stored procedures.

5. **Configure Azure Synapse Pipelines:**
   - Import the pipeline definitions from the `synapse-pipelines` directory into your Azure Synapse workspace.
   - Configure data source connections and set up necessary permissions.

6. **Power BI Reports:**
   - Open the Power BI report files (`.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
   - Configure the data source connections to point to your SQL database.
   - Publish the reports to Power BI Service.

7. **PowerApps Setup:**
   - Import the PowerApps package from the `powerapps` directory.
   - Configure the app connections to your SQL database.
   - Publish the app to your PowerApps environment.

#### Software Dependencies

- **SQL Server:** Required for database storage and management.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Required for data ingestion and transformation.
- **Power BI Desktop:** Required for creating and editing Power BI reports.
- **PowerApps:** Required for building and deploying the PowerApps.
- **Azure DevOps:** Required for CI/CD pipelines, boards, and artifact management.

### Build and Test

#### Building the Code

1. **SQL Database:**
   - Execute the SQL scripts in the `sql` directory to build the database schema, tables, views, and stored procedures.
   - Verify the database setup using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

2. **Azure Synapse Pipelines:**
   - Import the pipeline definitions from the `Pipelines` directory.
   - Configure and test data ingestion and transformation pipelines.

3. **Power BI Reports:**
   - Open the Power BI report files in Power BI Desktop.
   - Refresh data connections and verify the reports.

4. **PowerApps:**
   - Import the PowerApps package.
   - Test the app functionality and data connections.

#### Running Tests

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Write and execute unit tests for stored procedures and data transformation logic.
   - Use tools like SQL Test for testing SQL code.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test the end-to-end data flow from ingestion in Synapse Pipelines to visualization in Power BI.
   - Verify the PowerApps functionality with the integrated SQL database.

3. **User Acceptance Tests (UAT):**
   - Conduct UAT with sample data to ensure the solution meets business requirements.
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
